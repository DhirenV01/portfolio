Hi, I’m Dhiren Vazirani — a data engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that turn complex data into actionable insight. I’ve worked across cloud, AI, and analytics stacks, designing scalable pipelines, integrating LLMs into real-world workflows, and optimizing data infrastructure for teams that want to move faster and think smarter. Whether it’s architecting data models in the cloud or developing AI-driven tools that simplify decision-making, I’m driven by curiosity, impact, and making technology feel effortless.
